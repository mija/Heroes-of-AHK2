you might want to change a few things if you plan to use this.

the #HotIf's contain some keybinds. this is the assumptions made:
i opens inventory
c opens character screen
esc opens menu
1 + xbutton2 is bound to skill 1
2 + xbutton1 is bound to skill 2
3 + f is bound to skill 3

by default it is 3 + e that is skill 3, if i recall.

that's probably it. maybe not, probably though.
